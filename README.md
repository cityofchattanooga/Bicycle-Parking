Bicycle Parking Locations in the City of Chattanooga. 

## About
Chattanooogan's loves their bikes and their technology so why not mash these two up. The City of Chattanooga is posting locations of known bicycle parking facilities within the city on Github for anyone to update. 

## How to Contribute
1.  **Technical Way** To contribute, fork the project and update the bicycle_parking.geojson file and send a pull request with the changes. You can use Mapbox's nifty http://geojson.io/ project to work with the data in a browser if you are not familar with desktop Geographic Information Systems ("GIS") programs such as [QGIS] (http://www.qgis.org/en/site/). 

2.  **Non-Technical Way** Submit an [issue] (https://github.com/cityofchattanooga/Bicycle-Parking/issues) with a detailed description of the bicycle parking location (address, business, intersection), bicycle parking type, number of spaces and if possible the latitude and longitude.
